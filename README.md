- 👋 Hi, I’m Craig Kaufman.
- 👀 I’m interested in front end webapp developement, primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🌱 I've begun study of React.js and am currently working on a JavaScript tutorial site created entirely with React.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project requiring layout, styling, and functionality.
